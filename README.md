Multi OS Houdini Pipeline 

Installation for OS X and Linux:

 1. clone or download this repository to your server
 2. edit the *Houdini_Launcher.sh* and change the path from line 8 to your installation directory e.g." *export HOUDINI_PIPELINE="yourpath/Houdini_Pipeline*"
 3. copy the edited *Houdini_Launcher.sh* to all of your Project folder where you want to start Houdini. 
 4. if you like to run it without commandline, rename the launcher from *Houdini_Launcher.sh* to *Houdini_Launcher.command* which makes the file executable with a double click.
